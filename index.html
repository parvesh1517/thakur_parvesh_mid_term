    <h2>1.Customization:</h2>
    <p>
      Android allows for a higher level of customization. Users can change home
      screen layouts, use widgets, and even install alternative launchers to
      personalize the user experience to a greater extent than IOS. Android,
      being an open-source platform, offers a high degree of customization,
      allowing users to tweak various aspects of their devices and applications.
      Some of them are: Home Screen and Widgets, Wallpaper, Themes and
      Launchers, Notification Settings, Quick Settings and Status Bar, Fonts and
      Text Sizes, System Themes, Accessibility etc.

    <h2>2.Variety of Hardware Options:</h2>
    <p>
      Android devices come in various shapes, sizes, and price points, giving
      consumers more choices in terms of hardware. This diversity is one of
      Android's strengths, as it allows for a broad range of devices with
      varying capabilities and form factors. This means you can find Android
      devices that fit your budget and specific requirements.Here are some of
      the key hardware options you can find in Android devices:
      Smartphones,Tablets,Wearable Devices,Smart TVs,Gaming Consoles, Smart Home
      Devices,Drones and Robots,Foldable and Dual-Screen Devices etc.

    <h2>3.Open Ecosystem:</h2>
    <p>
      Android has a more open ecosystem, which can be an advantage for
      developers and power users who want more control over their devices. You
      can sideload apps from outside the official app stores and access the file
      system more freely.

    <h2>4.Google Services Integration:</h2>
    <p>
      Android is tightly integrated with Google services, which can be a
      significant advantage if you're heavily invested in the Google ecosystem
      (Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, etc.).
